## Hero Image
A captivating hero image was chosen to immediately grab the user's attention and spark their interest in the platform. This visually appealing image sets the tone for the entire user experience, creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere. The hero image is carefully selected to be appropriate for the target audience, reflecting the adventurous and budget-friendly spirit of the platform. The colors within the image are harmonized with the overall color scheme of the website, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design that enhances readability and user engagement.

## Colours
The color scheme is inspired by the vibrant and captivating hero image that greets users upon landing on the site. The primary colors were carefully selected to reflect the adventurous and budget-friendly spirit of the platform. These colors were then fine-tuned to create a balanced palette that is both visually appealing and functional, ensuring readability and a pleasant user experience whilst maintaining a professional and trustworthy appearance.

Fix

- Removed links to the manifest as not required at present but maybe for future development of a Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Bug 2
 - Hero image not displaying.

Fix

After exploring potential errors in the code such as unclosed blocks and wrongly addressed links, it was recognised that the error was due to a misaligniment of variables set in the root of the css file. Aligning these variables in the css file resulted in fixing the issue.
