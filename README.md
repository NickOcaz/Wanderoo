This visually appealing image sets the tone for the entire user experience, creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere. The hero image is carefully selected to be appropriate for the target audience, reflecting the adventurous and budget-friendly spirit of the platform.

The primary colors were carefully selected to reflect the adventurous and budget-friendly spirit of the platform.

## Bugs

### Bug 1

![Bug 1](assets/images/readme-images/bug1.png)

Fix

- Removed links to the manifest as not required at present but maybe for future development of a Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Bug 2
 - Hero image not displaying.

Fix

After exploring potential errors in the code such as unclosed blocks and wrongly addressed links, it was recognised that the error was due to a misaligniment of variables set in the root of the css file. Aligning these variables in the css file resulted in fixing the issue.

<a id="credits"></a>

During this project, Git was an essential tracking tool used to monitor the progress of the website towards final deployments. Git commits were used to allow version tracking and restoring previous states if needed amongst Git push, Git pull, Git add. These commits were stored and Github was used to store the project and deploy the site.

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, mental_health_deserves_awareness
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page
