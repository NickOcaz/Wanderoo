## Bugs

### Bug 1

![Bug 1](assets/images/readme-images/bug1.png)

Fix

- Removed links to the manifest as not required at present but maybe for future development of a Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Bug 2
 - Hero image not displaying.

Fix

After exploring potential errors in the code such as unclosed blocks and wrongly addressed links, it was recognised that the error was due to a misaligniment of variables set in the root of the css file. Aligning these variables in the css file resulted in fixing the issue.

## Deployment

<a id="credits"></a>

During this project, Git was an essential tracking tool used to monitor the progress of the website towards final deployments. Git commits were used to allow version tracking and restoring previous states if needed amongst Git push, Git pull, Git add. These commits were stored and Github was used to store the project and deploy the site.

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, mental_health_deserves_awareness
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page

## Future Features

## Team Collaboration
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/shifter-logo150x150.webp" alt="Shifter Logo">
</p>
Working as a team to produce this website has been an enriching experience that has significantly enhanced our problem-solving skills and confidence in various aspects of web development. We collaborated closely, leveraging each team member's strengths and expertise to overcome challenges and implement design features effectively.

### Problem Solving

Throughout the project, we encountered several obstacles that required innovative solutions. By brainstorming together and discussing different approaches, we were able to resolve issues efficiently. This collaborative problem-solving process not only improved the quality of our work but also fostered a strong sense of teamwork and mutual support.

### Independent Initiative

While teamwork was crucial, we also took the initiative to work independently on specific tasks. This balance allowed us to progress steadily, as each member contributed to different parts of the project simultaneously. Our ability to manage individual responsibilities while maintaining cohesive communication was key to our success.

### Confidence with Git Branches

One of the significant skills we developed was the use of Git branches. By creating and managing branches for different features and fixes, we ensured a smooth workflow and minimized conflicts. This practice has built our confidence in version control and collaborative coding, making us more proficient in handling complex projects.

### Developing Coding Skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Throughout the development of this project, we have significantly enhanced our coding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By working on various components of the website, we gained practical experience in structuring web pages, styling them to create visually appealing designs, and adding interactivity to enhance user engagement. This hands-on approach allowed us to deepen our understanding of these core web technologies, improve our problem-solving abilities, and become more proficient in creating dynamic and responsive web applications.

### Implementing AI to Support Our Development Goals

Integrating AI into our development process has been instrumental in achieving our project goals. AI tools have supported us in various aspects, including problem-solving, clarifying understanding, idea generation, image creation, and debugging. By leveraging AI, we were able to quickly generate innovative solutions to complex problems, gain deeper insights into challenging concepts, and produce creative ideas that enhanced our project's overall quality. Additionally, AI-assisted image creation allowed us to develop visually appealing graphics efficiently, while AI-driven debugging tools helped us identify and resolve code issues promptly. This integration of AI has significantly streamlined our workflow and contributed to the successful completion of our project.

### Design Implementation

Implementing the design elements of the website required meticulous attention to detail and a clear understanding of user experience principles. Through regular feedback sessions and iterative improvements, we were able to refine our design to meet the project's goals. This process has enhanced our ability to translate design concepts into functional and visually appealing web pages.

Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience, strengthening our technical skills and teamwork capabilities. We are proud of the website we have created and the collaborative effort that made it possible.
